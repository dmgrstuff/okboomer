It's just a simple Python program that compares input to predefined date ranges. Could definitely be more efficient, but eh.

# Actually running the thing
Assuming you have Python 3 installed ***(please install Python before running this lol)***, navigate to wherever you saved the file in your favorite and run `python3 okboomer.py`.
